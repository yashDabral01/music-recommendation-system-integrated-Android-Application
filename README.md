# Music Recommendation System Integrated Android Application ðŸŽµðŸ“±

I have developed an **Android application** that includes a module for a **Music Recommendation System**, which I built entirely on my own using **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **Machine Learning** techniques.  

The recommendation system uses preprocessed datasets and models to suggest music based on user preferences and patterns.  

ðŸ“‚ **Note:**  
The large CSV datasets and other important project files are stored externally on Google Drive to keep the repository lightweight. You can access them here:
